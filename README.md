## 🚀 Project Overview

RetailVerse empowers retailers to simulate decisions like:
- Switching to bamboo packaging
- Adjusting security policies (e.g., 2FA)
- Implementing new sustainability practices

...and see how these changes affect:
- ✅ Customer trust and feedback
- 🔒 Fraud risk levels
- 🌍 Environmental sustainability (CO₂ footprint)
- 📈 Overall impact on ethical governance

An AI recommendation engine (Flask backend) suggests sustainable and trust-building practices based on scenario inputs.
